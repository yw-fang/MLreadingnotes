# Common errors in VASP

- VERY BAD NEWS! internal error in subroutine SGRCON

This error is usually caused by the symmetry accuracy of structure. 
Some solutions include 1) including SYMPREC, 2) turn off symmetry by
ISYM = 1 or 0, 3) higher kpoints

- The isovalue of ELF in vesta is extremely low.

ELFCAR is generated by VASP, if we copy it to ABO3.vasp, and open ABO3.vasp
with VESTA, we will find the isovalue is only about 0.00X, this is not reasonable
because it's too small. I find that, if we copy it to ELFCAR.vasp, VESTA can then
read the isovalue in the right way.
