I have used Quantum Espresso since 2012 when I started my PhD program.
In the period of my PhD study, I wrote some notes for the electronic calculations using Quantum Espresso.
Unfortunately, those notes were lost with my broken Thinkpad. 

I started to write this new note on Quantum Espresso from Jan 2018 in Kyoto.
