In particular, during my stay at NYU Shanghai, I searched the ground state structure of LiOsO$_3$, the results can be found in the supplementary materials of this paper ([Pressure-induced enhancement of non-polar to polar transition temperature in metallic LiOsO3](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5035133)) on Applied Physics Letter."
