# 1. Using Dr.Probe

The website: https://er-c.org/barthel/drprobe/ shows the code Dr.Probe to do the STEM simulations. 

Here is an example: https://er-c.org/barthel/drprobe/example-celfile-sto110.html

I do have some ideas to make this code more flexible and integrate it to more codes.

But let me stop here for the time being.
