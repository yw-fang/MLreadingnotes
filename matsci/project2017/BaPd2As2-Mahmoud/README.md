The work on BaPd2As2 was started by Mahmoud's group. He asked me to carry out
first principles calculations in the year of 2017.

The paper about this work was submitted to PRB, and we got the reviewers' comments
in Jan. 2018.

The reviewers requested some results on the N(Ef) and Tc. Hence, I added some time
time-consuming electron phonon coupling calculations.
