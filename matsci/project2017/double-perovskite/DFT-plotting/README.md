BYOO-Hubbard-fixexp-u0.txt is same to BYOO-pressure-fixexp-1.00Volume.txt or BYOO-SOC-fixexp-SOC10.txt
because it's the stardard DFT+SO calculations for the exprimental structure using the orginal VASP.

Differences between BYOO-24coplanar-new.txt and BYOO-24coplanar.txt
The only difference is that BYOO-24coplanar-new.txt is obtained by a POSCAR which is (0.5,0.5,0.5) shifted
from the POSCAR in BYOO-24coplanar.txt.
