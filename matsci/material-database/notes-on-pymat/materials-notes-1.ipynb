    "5) Open chrome, type 'localhost:8282'\n",

    "6) You will now get access to the jupyter notebook locally. For the first login, it may ask you to input token. But how to get the token?  Just go back to your Comet terminal, and run 'jupyter noteook list', it will givee you an address of server, such as 'http://localhost:8282/?token=abcdefddddddddd :: .....', just fill in the token using 'abcdefddddddddd'. If 'jupyter notebook list' command does not work for you, please open notebook.log for the information of token.\n",
