    "Recently, I ploted a 3D energy profile using Wolfram Mathematica 11 for one of my research papers. For 3D figures, Mathematica cannot export vector PDF. To further retouch my figure, I exported the rastered PDF from Mathematica, and imported it into Inkscape (I used Inkscape in a Windows system). After adding some text and labels to the figure, I found the 3D colored part in the figure will be vanished if I exported it into PDF from Inkscape. \n",
