## About

The book ${python data science cookbook}$ by Gopi Subramanian
was published in the year of 2015. The POST $\&$ TELECOM PRESS
in China introduced this book in the year of 2016, and it was
translated into Chinese. What I read was a Chinese version which
I bought in Shanghai, China in the year of 2017 before I moved
to Kyto. I started to read this book in the cherry blossom season
of 2018 in Kyoto.

I collectd some ![Errata](./Errata_en.txt) for the English version
from PACKT publishing website.
They may also exsit in the Chinese version 
(See ![Errata for Chinese](./Errata_ch.txt) written by myself).
