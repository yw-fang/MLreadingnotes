# Hi, Markdown

I came to know Markdown in summer of 2017 through the 
'[Markdown Tutorial](http://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/)'.
It provides a very fast and simple way for us to know the basics of
Markdown. I strongly recommend it to you if you are new to Markdown.

Since this repo. is mainly composed by jupyter notebooks
with markdown style, I list some resources here about the
writing style of markdown.

Many thanks to the authors for sharing their 
knowledge on markdown with us.

$\mathcal{H}$.
